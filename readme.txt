This plugin allows you to display a pre-made Top 10 Style list on your site. Choose a topic - we do the rest.  A great way to add fresh content.

== Description ==

The Top 7 is a collection of premade, user voted, Top 10 style lists.  This plugin allows you to tap into this content without any fees, subscriptions or accounts.  Use the plugin to display a Top 7 list in your posts and pages right from your wordpress installation.  

While editing a post simply hit the provided control button (tinyMCE button) to be presented with the Top 7 control panel.  Using this control panel you can search and select your desired Top 7 list to include in your post.  A shortcode snippet is inserted into your post which is then rendered into the final Top 7 list.

Several options are provided to allow you to customize how your Top 7 list is displayed.  For example you can choose to hide the text based description and skip right to the list.

Users can interact with the content.  They can vote the answers up or down as well as submit the content to various Social Channels such as Facebook, GooglePlus and Twitter.

All topics and data is maintained by Dimbal Softare, owner of the TheTop7.com - you don't have to worry about a thing.  Just choose your topic and the plugin does the rest.

Topic lists are updated automatically all the time.  You can always view http://www.thetop7.com for more.
